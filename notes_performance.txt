About Arduino perrformance

- because of beginner focus more focus on security than on speed
 -> other microcontrollers might have better perfomance
 
- arduino uses all of its processor, all the time -> although some of the basuc commands, like DigitalWWrite or AnalogRead could e overwritten with focus
on better performance

About Raspberry Pi performance

-proposal:
- focus mostly on raspberry performance, as Arduino improvemenst ca only happen with a better microcontrollller
 or rewriting importnat functions

Relevnat performance metrics or at least things we should take a look at:
- time per program = clock period * cycles per instruction * instructions executed per program 
- Clock rate
- Cycles per Instruction
- execution time 
- turnaround time(amybe after the tarcked object has disappeared)
-(availability) - not for us, only one is using the system
- wall clock time(time elapsed as seen on clock or stopeatch from program  start till now)
- response time(how long it takes until CPU reacts(to an obviious movement))
- throoughput(MIPS is one way of measuring throughput)
- scalability(how does teh system handle faster movements)

possibly useful linux commnads commands:
- nice
-iostat
-sar
-pstree
-ps
-xmperf
- System Monitir in Linux
- top in 
- htop 

improvement options:
- get better raspberry(Model 4+), as they have better CPU and vÂ´can have more RAM
- overclocking(be aware of negative consequwnces)
-better SD-card(SSD?)
- experient with/add a GPU
- prevent overhaeting with air cooler
 -always potentially better performance by refactoring current code

Open questions:
-would using raspberry pi camera lead too better runtimr
- if we want to test program performance of that one program, do benchmarks like the following ones even make sense
(
- these first 2 benchmarks for pi itself:https://u-labs.de/portal/raspberry-pi-geschwindigkeit-messen-mit-diesen-benchmarks-testest-du-wie-schnell-dein-pi-ist/
- other options: linpack/ ramspeed-smp(folloeing site already has graphs for diff pi models though:
https://magpi.raspberrypi.com/articles/raspberry-pi-4-specs-benchmarks)
